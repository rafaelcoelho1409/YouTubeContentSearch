they\u0027re a bunch of people in Los Angeles in some small little room executives from record companies and they\u0027re all scratching their heads going what do you want doing this guy named yawning you know he plays classical music he plays jazzy plays rock and roll he plays this is pleased are you playing electronic music it\u0027s doing that would what do we categorize image and I can see this one little guy in the back going why don\u0027t we call New Age and everybody went that sounds really good there\u0027s one little problem about that new age becomes old age very fast"}, {"color":

five years to finish it took me that long because I worked with some of the best musicians in the world and I took my time because I wanted to create an album that would create an atmosphere for the listener that was first of all sensuous I wanted to be melodious I wanted it to be rhythmic at the same time I wanted it to be sexy and I also wanted it to last a long time that\u0027s why there are 17 songs on this album the album is not demanding it does not demand your attention to enjoy it it\u0027s a it\u0027s meant to be an album that you put on repeat and let it play and it came out of a need I made it for me because I\u0027ve been trying to listen to albums I mean stations on on the web that might I would might appreciate and I could never find one because sometimes they\u0027ll be ok for five minutes and then it would be something else and something else and something else and then to be another good piece and then a bunch of not so good pieces falling so out of desperation I decided cues what I want I want this when they I wanted precisely in this fashion and so it was it works for me I hope people enjoy that\u0027s very difficult to pick they I cannot say this track or that track with that track because that pigeonholes the album and my favorite tracks usually tend to be the ones that I\u0027m working on at the time once they all come together is one the whole album becomes a track there is a beginning a middle and an end and it flows like a song oh don\u0027t even ask about the Technicolor ass that is not an easy concert to do any time you see any plane at the Acropolis Taj Mahal the Forbidden City the pyramids or any of that stuff I assume it is a year\u0027s worth of preparations and work Oh a lot of people the experience though was phenomenal and it wasn\u0027t just the experience of performing there it\u0027s the fact that the Egyptian people took us in they protected us they loved us they showed us their love we went into places where nobody is allowed to go we went inside the pyramids we went to the national museums we went to I mean we were inundated with our culture and their culture is phenomenal of course there\u0027s always a security challenge whenever you go to the Middle East but I have been in the Middle East many many times after we left Egypt we went to Sharjah not that there is any"}, {"color": "#97c2fc", "id": "John Doe",
